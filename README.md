# FlavorFind

Getting Started
To run the Flavor Find application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.

# Install dependencies
cd flavor-find/server
npm install

cd ../client
npm install

# Start the client (in a new terminal window)
cd ../client
npm start

cd ../server
npm start

The client and server should both now be running in two terminals.
To run the application, you need to start both the server and the client. In the server folder, run npm start to start the server. Then, in a new terminal window, navigate to the client folder and run npm start to start the client-side application.
